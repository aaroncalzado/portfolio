Title: Client Onboarding
----
Subtitle: On of my final projects at RKG was to streamline the client onboarding process for Blueprint Analytics. Unlike the onboarding processes found in most online services where onboarding is fully, Blueprint’s onboarding is a collaborative process for both the clients and Blueprint Analysts.

##### 1.A - Basic Client Info

When a client agrees to start using Blueprint Analytics, Blueprint analysts begin the onboarding process by selecting “Onboard New Clients”.

##### 1.B - Basic Client Info

They will begin by filling out basic client details provided by the client.

Note: All these options can be edited on a later date by Blueprint analysts and selected admin users selected by the client.

##### 1.C - Basic Client Info

Once completed, analysts can then notify the client to begin the setup process on installing Blueprint Analytics on their servers to begin collecting data.

##### 2.A - Assigning Sites

Per the client’s request, Blueprint analysts will then begin to add all sites with Blueprint Analytics installed.

##### 2.B - Assigning Sites

Once all the sites are added, Blueprint analysts can choose to activate these sites so Blueprint Analytics can begin collecting and process the data.

##### 2.C - Assigning Sites

Once Blueprint Analytics recognizes the client’s servers, analysts can then notify the client and begin the categorization process.

##### 3.A - Configuring Categories

The initial categorization is a separate collaborative process with the client’s SEO manager and Blueprint analysts in tailoring Blueprint Analytics for their specific needs.

##### 3.B - Configuring Categories

Since the categorization process is a neverending process that’s constantly being updated, analysts can choose to proceed to the next onboarding step.

##### 4.A - Adding Users

The first set of users are created by Blueprint analysts which can then be edited at a later time by admins assigned by the client.

##### 4.B - Adding Users

Once a user is created, analysts now have the ability to launch the client’s Blueprint Analytics service.

##### 5.A - Launch
