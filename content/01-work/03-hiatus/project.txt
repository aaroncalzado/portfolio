Title: Hiatus

Subtitle: Sitting too long can be very hazardous to your long-term health and is linked to repetitive stress injuries, increased risk of obesity, and other longterm illnesses. However, taking a break from sitting can lower the risks of problems that arise from sitting too long.

Intro:

_Hiatus_ is a concept chair designed to solve the common problem of sitting too long and too frequently without standing up. Made with an Arduino Uno, custom components, and some second-hand hardware, _Hiatus_ converts an average office chair into a gentle reminder that it’s time to get up. Every 30 minutes, _Hiatus_ gives its occupant a nudge that they’ve sat long enough, and becomes more forceful (and harder to ignore) if needed.

##### Why?

One of the major disadvantages in leading a sedentary lifestyle includes greatly reducing your chances of retaining physical independence when you get old.	 Recent studies show that getting your week’s of exercise is important but it can’t provide protection against sitting disease like taking a break and getting off your butt. Even taking as little as an extra half-hour off your ass can significantly help in your longterm health. Health problems aside, one of the biggest problems of leading a sedentary lifestyle is that we don’t talk or think about it nearly as much as dieting and exercise.

##### Design Process
We created a simple diagram outlining the basic functions and materials required for our chair.

###### This diagram allowed us to plan out our next steps, and assess what electrical components and Arduino programming we might need.

###### For the next several weeks, we worked hard to develop working code for the Arduino. For this chair we needed the Arduino to keep track of time spent sitting down and time spent taking a break. We also needed to instruct the Arduino to sense and activate the appropriate microswitches for the chair’s motor.

##### Process Sketches and Ideations

Despite being illegible outside of the design context at the time, here are excerpt process sketches that were used in the development of the _Hiatus_ Chair.

##### Chair “Brain” Development

These are images showcasing the prototyping process and development of the chair brain and its components.

##### Hacking the Chair
Gutting out the chair was a necessary step to provide room for the brain and other moving components.

##### Hardware and Software Testing
Vigorous testing of the code was done to prevent the chair from killing itself.

##### Retrospect
The _Hiatus_ chair concept was well received among our peers and was a major feat acomplished by both Kelly and I. Prior to working on this project, neither of us had any experience in developing in the Processing/Arduino environment, nor did we have any experience in deconstructing existing artifacts and cannibalizing them to hack together our own homebrew artifact. In hindsight, we realized the _Hiatus_ chair required a much higher level of skill in construction and engineering.

These were critical things we lacked during the development of the _Hiatus_ chair. Unfortunately, neither of us had sufficient knowledge [at the time] in materials and construction and ended up breaking our chair during testing. Fortunately, we were able to film the chair in action for our video prototype as well as documenting its demise.
