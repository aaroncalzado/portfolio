Intro:

The Kinect × Three Little Pigs is an interactive storybook that explore new ways young readers can experience the traditional art of storytelling. Our interactive book is designed to captivate young readers through graphically enhanced narratives  and engaging interactions that is reminiscent of reading with an adult.

> Sharing a storybook with a child can be one of the most rewarding experiences a parent can do for a child. When an adult reads with a young child, they provide a host of well-documented benefits that support a lifetime of good reading habits.

Breakdown:

<!-- Our design for an interactive book shares a number of behaviors and affordances with this model and is optimized for new and pre-readers.

The interactions are designed to mediate and guide young readers through the conventions that determine narrative flow. Narrative structure appeals to young children’s affinity for predictable outcomes, empowering young readers and facilitating immersion.

In addition, multiple pathways of interaction, including gesture, posture, and voice, enhance the interactive experience and promote kinesthetic learning. In addition to simulating the adult/child reading dynamic, the use of the Kinect affords an additional layer of interaction. -->

##### Design Concept

<!-- We crafted a version of The Three Little Pigs that will engage early readers in an interactive experience while maintaining the familiar structure and flow of a traditional narrative. Unlike other interactive experiences, our book maintains the linear structure of conventional storytelling but affords the child an opportunity to immerse themselves in the narrative. At the same time, the child has the opportunity to explore words or images further, thus investing them in the reading experience. Alternatively, should the child desire a more passive experience, the book would sense a lower activity level and continue without waiting for interactions.

In contrast to video games or multi-path books our design concept is intended to retain a linear narrative. Young children enjoy predictable outcomes and are willing experiencing the same story over and over. Predicting the flow of the story is empowering for children and aids in the assimilation of reading skills. While the sandbox model may be exciting for an adult to explore, having an unstructured story can cause a child to lose interest. The interactions in the “Three Little Pigs” we developed for the Xbox Kinect is intended to engage children and promote kinesthetic learning. -->

##### Engaging Visuals

We decided early on as a team to not create a full blow animated game. As much as possible, we wanted to keep the look and feel of a traditional storybook but with a twist. We tastefully added dynamic content to specific elements in the storybook to enhance the storytelling experience without downplaying the reader’s use of their imagination.

##### Read at Your Own Pace

Paired with the Kinect, our interactive storybook is adaptive to the level of involvement exhibited by the reader. The reader has the ability stand up and take control of the story exploring words and objects. This causes them to really invest themselves in the interactive reading experience. Alternatively, should the reader desire a more passive experience, the Kinect can sense the lower activity level and continue the story.

##### Gesture Guidance

An important component of our interactive storybook are the visual cues that prompts our readers to perform specific functions. One method we are using to achieve this is a small pig avatar in the lower left corner. In this particular example, the pig prompts the reader by acting out the gestures the child must perform.

##### Do You Have A Question?

<div class="bareVideo"><video controls muted width="75%" controls autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">

If a reader decides to ask a question about the content by raising their hand, the screen will grey out except for the content with definitions in the system. For example, they can highlight a portion of the text to have it read to them, or select an object to see what it is called and receive a definition.

##### Breaking the Fourth Wall

Manipulation of the ‘fourth wall’ and characters’ interaction with typography highlights the relationship between the written word, the images and ideas they relate to, and the narrative structure. This enhances word/object correlation.

##### Initial Concept

We mapped out core functions through storyboarding and produced lo-fi video mockups to visualize and critique our ideas. At the same time we learned the history and basic fundamentals of gestural input under Kay Hofmeester.

<!-- We also explored the Kinect’s technical capabilities and began outlining its possible uses in our interactive storybook. -->

##### Interaction Flowchart

Teammate Dave Opincariu drafted up an interaction flowchart based off of our group meetings and discussions. This flowchart was used as a rough outline to plan out the different interactions we thought about including into our interactive story book.

##### Concept Development and Video Prototyping

In the early stages of concept development, we drafted storyboards and produced rough video cuts to quickly present our design ideas. Instead of illustrating diagrams, we found that filming ourselves was a great way to prototype gestures.

##### Developing a Gesture Language

We explored an array of possible gestures we could use in our interactive storybook and decided to make the gestural inputs a supplementary feature that give children the option to either read passively or actively interact with the storybook.

Ultimately, not every gesture shown in this section made it to our final design. We narrowed it down by removing gestures like “Hug” and “Hold (Items from Falling)” because these gestures were either being occupied by more important functions that played a bigger role in progressing the story.

> Our graphic style was inspired by keeping the elements of a storybook, yet embracing the new visual capabilities of the Xbox 360 and Kinect.

****

##### Developing a Visual Style

We wanted young readers to feel connected to the characters and pay attention to the physical act of reading while interacting with our book. To create the a child-like storybook fitting for our target demographic, we analyzed visuals and illustration styles found in popular children’s entertainment.

(image: mood-board-01.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: mood-board-01.jpg width: 75%)

###### Mood board of visual styles we wanted to emulate in our storybook.

##### Developing a Typographic Style

Some main components of our graphical style include breaking the fourth wall, dynamic and interesting perspectives, playing with typography, and maintaining a simple sketch-like quality to our illustrations. We felt that this style was appropriate for small children because it would keep them interested in the story. We picked up on these techniques by examining several popular children’s books and television shows.

##### Translating the Storybook Experience for the Digital Age

<!-- Edit the wording in this paragraph. -->

Children storybooks are built on rich visual spreads that demands attention from its viewers. In our storybook, we intended to create wide landscaping visuals that children can explore. In any given scene children will be able to pan through the spread and examine page and its objects in detail.

(image: mood-board-03.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: mood-board-03.jpg width: 75%)

###### Mood board of elaborate storybook spreads.

##### Setting the Mood with Color

We chose a few simple, cohesive color palettes for our story. The general background contains a muted texture to imitate the feeling of a storybook and keep an analogous appearance across scenes.

(image: colors.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: colors.jpg width: 75%)


###### Within the palettes that we chose, the colors are warm and inviting, which matches the tone that we are striving for.

(image: colors-muted.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: colors-muted.jpg width: 75%)


###### Components of a scene that are not key in the current interaction will appear muted to bring greater focus on the important content.

<!-- , allowing the child to follow the story and be more aware of the actions that they are prompted to perform. -->

##### System Typefaces and Typography Guidelines

For the typography in our interactive story we chose several different typefaces that would work well together, yet contrast enough for the reader to recognize shifts in dialogue. We chose to display body copy in Archer because it is a friendly slab serif that matches the visual style of a traditional storybook, as well as our visual style.

(image: typography-narrator.png class: projectCenterImage link: typography-narrator.png width: 66%)

##### Little Pig Typeface

For the dialogue of the pigs we selected Gotham Rounded. We felt that it reflected their cheeky personalities, and the roundness emulated the feeling of a pig.

(image: typography-pig.png class: projectCenterImage link: typography-pig.png width: 66%)

##### Big Bad Wolf Typeface

And finally, for the wolf’s dialogue, we chose Tungsten Medium because it reflects his tough exterior and cunning demeanor.

(image: typography-wolf-01.png class: projectCenterImage link: typography-wolf-01.png width: 66%)

In order to keep the child interested in the content of the story and focused on reading, we have added many playful elements to the type. For example, when the wolf comes to blow down the pig’s house, the reader is prompted with repeating the sentence, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” The type grows larger depending on the child’s volume, adding to the playfulness.

(image: typography-wolf-04.png class: projectCenterImage link: typography-wolf-04.png width: 66%)

##### Other Uses of Type

Occasionally, words and type also becomes an informative tool for learning about certain objects in a scene. For example, when young readers pull a turnip out of the ground, the bottom half of the vegetable reads, “turnip,” creating a word-to-object association.

##### Putting It All Together

Producing a concept video for our interactive storybook was necessary to demonstrate our design in context and to showcase the value of the product to our audience.
