Intro: Let’s Get Together is a digital calendar concept for smartphones developed to explore new ways to input data, visualize calendar information, and encourage spontaneous social gatherings with other people. We created a video prototype showcasing how we envision digital calendar system being used with current (2010) smartphone technology.

##### Why?

While it may be straightforward for a user to use a digital calendar system to organize their own scheduled events, current (2010) smartphone calendar systems are not yet optimized for users coordinating calendar events with other people. Also, many data entry systems on smartphone touch screens are not designed with the small form factor in mind, but rather built to mimic the familiar desktop experience. And finally, feature rich digital calendars allow for information overload.

We wanted to showcase different methods in displaying calendar information optimized for the smartphone form factor.

We also wanted to show that, our calendar system is more than just an organization tool and can be used as a communication tool that will help users coordinate events with other people.

In this screen, users can peruse through their contact’s public schedule and invite a contact to a new/existing event. Users can opt to call their contacts directly and skip the entire invite process.

Data entry was an issue in the event creation process. As a team, we thought the different situations users will be in and the numerical ranges people use when scheduling events. Instead of having to set dates and time via pressing keyboard buttons, we explored a different method of setting dates and time by using a scrubbing action in the input section.

When adding locations to events, users can easily search for nearby locations by using the smartphone’s GPS and responsive search.

When a users receive an invite to new events, at a high level, they can review events and choose to either accept or decline invitations. Users can also select an event and view its information in greater detail.

On this screen users can visually compare the event scheduled, their own schedule, and the other invitees’ public schedule.

<div class="ip4vv"><video width="27%" controls autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">

Despite having multiple levels of information, users do not need to dive deep into an event to send a response.

Guts:
##### Design Process

Total active time spent on this project was ten weeks with heavy emphasis on research and development. Much of our research and development was used learning about existing calendar systems from a variety of different time periods and mediums.

###### A snapshot of a class-wide whiteboard discussion on calendars.

###### This is one of the many calendar systems we observed. The image is a scan of an old Japanese train schedule. Although there wasn’t a direct application for this in our project, it was examples like this that broadened our views on how to visually represent time and events.

##### Developing a Model

We prototyped paper models in order to gain focus on who we want to design for and what issues we’re trying to address.

##### Refine the Model

Once we refined our models a higher fidelity mockup of our model is then created to help solidify the areas we want to design for.

###### This model in particular is a breakdown of different things one may consider when scheduling an event. This helped us distinguish the differences in scheduling events for work and play and helped narrow down what type of situation we want to design for. As a group we decided to design a calendar that encourages spontaneous meetings among friends with smartphones.

##### Paper Sketching
After figuring out our target demographic we want to design for, we began sketching interface designs.

##### Digital Wireframing
Here are examples of early digital mockups to test out how our design sketches would possibly look on screen. Some design elements from these prototypes were later implemented into our final design with updated visual graphics.

###### We were very drawn to the layered timeline and the structure it allows in representing information. We used this wireframe as a base and pushed it forward to the final design.
