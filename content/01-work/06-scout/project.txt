Intro:

> **Scout’s purpose is to do two things:** Build an accurate profile
> of it’s owner and find suitable relationship matches
> based on these profiles.

****

Scout is designed to make appropriate judgments about it’s user by silently collecting data unsoiled by the user’s biases. This way possible relationships could be found based upon how the users really are. Although this information is shared transparently between Scouts, the actual users can only see what is shared.

##### Why?

We were inspired by the rapid interactions during speed dating, and wondered 
how could we combine these concepts with technology and apply them to real world situations.

Dating culture in Seattle sucks. Seattle freeze.

Breakdown:

##### How Scout Works
Scout gathers data from what you do, what you say, where you go, what you hear, and anything else it’s able to measure with its internal sensors. In addition, it can also communicate with other devices such as smartphones, e-books, computers, and RFID tagged objects to gather more contextual data.

Using speech transcription algorithms already available in many devices, conversations and audio can be logged, time stamped, and located using the GPS to mark where events happened.

GPS can be used to recognize when the Scout has entered a restaurant, how far the device has traveled, and many other applications.

Nearby Scouts are always in communication, making the data they have accumulated useful for comparing profiles and finding new people.

The Scouts communicate with each other either through Bluetooth when they’re within a close enough radius, or through NFC (Near Field Communication) when they’re within a few inches away. All this data is saved on an internal flash drive and uploaded to the user’s online profile through WIFI whenever available.

When a match has been found based on your combined interests, your Scout pings you with a vibration, and the indicator also syncs with your match’s Scout.

To formally introduce your Scout to someone else’s, all you need to do is tap them together. As we all know, a computer can’t create love, so the rest is up to you.

Guts:
##### Initial Research

To gain a better understanding of the speed dating process we initially mapped out the process based off of secondary research material found on the web.

###### For a quick rundown on the history of speed dating, check out the Wikipedia (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_dating text: article popup: yes).

##### Concept and Ideations

Early on, both Miles and I were interested in the (link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRU3NemA95k text: Microsoft Surface coffee table popup:yes) concept and wanted to involve some playful interactivity in the speed dating process. For most speed dating virgins, meeting new people and having a time constraint can be nerve-wracking. And more often than not speed daters spend a good part of their speed dates warming up rather than really getting to know their partner. With an interactive table, we were thinking up ideas to assist speed daters on how to effectively hold an engaging speed date conversation.

(image: concept-01.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: concept-01.jpg width: 75%)

This concept people believe they’re what they seem. We wanted a device that could capture data and metrics about the user and compile it into a comprehensive report objectively detailing what the user is really like.

(image: concept-02.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: concept-02.jpg width: 75%)

This concept, we wanted to remove speed daters from the speed dating location and put them in a more natural environment.

(image: concept-03.jpg class: projectCenterImageDS link: concept-03.jpg width: 75%)

We also observed other forms of dating and some of the different components involved in the process.

##### Infield Research

Subjected myself to an actual speed dating event.

Pros: No need to initiate, meet a ton of people, like-minded people looking for the same thing

Cons: Not enough time, can be disorganized, men rotate while women don’t have to do as much work

##### Product Development
While further refining the Scout ecosystem we began to explore the physical design aspect of Scout and its possible uses. We sketched up multiple concepts exploring the shape and form of Scout. We ended up choosing a pedometer/dongle form factor and began physically prototyping with balsa wood and other cheap materials. Screen-less etc.

In this diagram, we outlined the product specs and technology required to run Scout.

Ending:
<!-- ##### Retrospect
It was a challenge to develop something for the dating subculture in Seattle because it is very subjective/organic/not easy to deal with despite already working off of a structured process like speed dating. Would like to possibly elaborate on the Urban Speed Dating concept. Maybe not rely on a single device to rule everything, rather take a MyFitnessPal approach to address this issue. Use a bunch of different services. -->
