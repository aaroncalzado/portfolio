Intro: _Crate to Plate_ is a subscription service designed to foster a healthy lifestyle for students, by making local food more convenient. _Crate to Plate_ delivers a series of seasonal local ingredients, paired with recipes, making the process of buying and cooking local food more accessible. This cuts down on waste, which saves money, and helps students to learn how to prepare meals for themselves. _Crate to Plate_ was inspired by our desire to provide healthy local food while saving money and time for University students.

Breakdown:
##### Service Overview

The _Crate to Plate_ service works alongside current food distribution systems and local farmers in the local food market. It pairs food with specific recipes to maximize the use of all the ingredients delivering “crates”, minimizing waste. Through using this service, students will learn more about local food and how to cook for themselves.

###### 1. Crate to Plate works closely with local farmers around the area to produce quality recipes using crops in season.
###### 2. Crate to Plate will partner up with existing delivery distribution services to take care of delivery so they can work on providing customers with high quality balanced meals.
###### 3. The local food experience doesn’t end when food reaches the customer’s doorstep. Valuable feedback from customers via voting will help expand and improve the Crate to Plate catalog.

##### Online Website
The _Crate to Plate_ website is the digital gateway for students to access local food. Students can manage their subscriptions and confirm their orders prior to delivery. They can also participate in weekly voting for the next week’s crate. This gives students an opportunity to voice their opinions on their likes and dislikes. This allows for a variety of recipes to be explored. Students also have access to _Crate to Plate_’s catalog of recipes and shopping lists for each related recipe.

##### Recipe Cards
_Crate to Plate_ includes recipe cards that not only show the ingredients with an identifying image, but also incorporate easy-to-follow directions so students can make their favorite recipes as many times as they want! Each card explains how long the meal will take to make, so students can plan their meals based upon their busy schedules.

##### The “Crate”
Each crate provides every ingredient needed for three distinct meals and multiple servings. It’s delivered in an easily manufactured box that clearly defines which ingredients go with their specific recipe.

Part of our design was to create a container which would hold the correct amount of produce along with being able to have sorting areas within and be able to easily stack for transportation and delivery. Towards the end of our project it was decided on to make the following design due to the ability to be either recycled or composted and stored into the typical household refrigerator.

##### Phone App

With the _Crate to Plate_ app, users are able to track their next Crate’s arrival, as well as also use all of the functions of the website. Another helpful function that is incorporated into the app, is the shopping list feature. If students decide to try a new recipe they can download the shopping list for that recipe so they are sure to get everything they need at the store!
