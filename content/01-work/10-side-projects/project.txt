##### Block Printing, Fall 2012
During the fall of 2012 I decided to try my hand at block printing. I carved my design out of a soft synthetic printing block and printed it with water-based ink on watercolor paper.

##### Lava Lamp and Poster, 2010

In the fall of 2010 I designed and built a lamp for one of my sophomore design classes. For this project I really wanted to design a lamp that visually represented my home state, Hawai‘i. My concept for the lamp revolved around the (link: https://www.google.com/search?q=p%C4%81hoehoe&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=LgJOU_uLLMa0ygGD44DABg&sqi=2&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1440&bih=779 text: visual aesthetics popup: yes) of lava (specifically pāhoehoe) and what it symbolizes in Hawaiian culture.

This lamp one of a kind lamp was made with paper, hot glue, plastic tubing, and cut with an X-ACTO knife by hand.

I also designed an accompanying poster based off the visual aesthetics of the lamp.

##### Silkscreened Shirt, 2008
Back in the summer of 2008 I became interested in silkscreen printing. One the the designs I produced that year was a silkscreened t-shirt. Fifty of these shirts were printed and dropped off at random places around downtown Honolulu. All the shirts had a call to action attached to them which pointed to my personal website. I was able to track all the shirts and make sure they were all picked up via people accessing the unique web address and Google Analytics. Unfortunately, the status of them being worn is still unknown.
