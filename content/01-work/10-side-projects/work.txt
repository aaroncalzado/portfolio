Neue Poster Graphics is a on-going side project I created for myself to practice and experiment with front-end development techniques. I take iconic posters and reinterpret them for today’s digital screens. This marries my first love of graphic design and my growing interest in front-end development.

Every month, IxDA UW invites professionals within the design industry to present on their experiences and share their wealth of knowledge to the design community at UW. In here, you will find a collection posters I designed for some of the speakers we had at the IxDA Lecture series.

The Lava Lamp was a lamp I designed during my sophomore year in design school. The physical aesthetics of the lamp were based off the visual aesthetics of lava in Hawai‘i and the five basic principles of design — balance, contrast, rhythm, focus, and unity.
